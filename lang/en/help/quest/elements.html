<P align="justify">In order to assess an answer submitted to a
	challenge a number of &quot;Assessment Elements&quot; will be defined,
	covering each one a particular aspect to be assessed in the answers
	submitted and depending its number on the size and complexity of the
	challenge. The elements will have the following characteristics:
<div align="justify">
	<OL>
		<li>DESCRIPTION of the assessment element. It should clearly
			determine which aspect of the task is being assessed. In the case of
			a qualitative assessment, it will be useful to provide details of
			what is considered excellent, average, etc.</li>
		<li>SCALE of the assessment element. There are several
			predetermined scales, from the simple YES/NO scale, to a scale of
			total percentage. Each assessment element will use its own scale,
			which must be choosen so that it can adjust to each possible
			variation of the element. However, it must be taken into account that
			the scale does not determine how important an assessment element is
			when the final score is calculated: for example, an element with a
			2-point scale will have the same &quot;influence&quot; in the final
			score than another element that uses a 100-point scale, whenever the
			respective elements has the same <i>weight</i> or ponderation factor.
		</li>
		<li>WEIGHT of the assessment element. By default, each element
			has the same importance when the final score of the task is
			calculated. However, this fact can be changed by giving the more
			important elements a weight higher than one, and to the less
			important elements a weight lower than one. It must be also taken
			into account that to modify the weight does NOT affect the possible
			maximum score of a submitted answer, because this value is determined
			by the <a href="help.php?module=quest&file=maxcalification.html">Highest
				Score</a> parameter set for the challenge to which the answer is being
			submitted and the time when it was submitted.
		</li>
	</OL>
	<P align="justify">The system allows to customise the set of
		assessment elements defined for each challenge added to a
		QUESTOURnament.
