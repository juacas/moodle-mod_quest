				Teams</a> is selected in the QUESTOURnament. It is the percentage, set
			by the option <a href="help.php?module=quest&file=teamporcent.html">Percentage

			the student belongs, that will be added to his individual score.</li>

		It must be emphasized that the teachers have access to all the
		information listed above, while the students can only see that
		information if the teacher that defined the QUESTOURnament selected
		the option <a
			href="help.php?module=quest&file=showauthoringdetails.html">Show
			Authoring Details to the Students in Classifications</a>. In any other
		case, students will not have access to these partial data related to
		the challenges proposed by other students.
	</p>
	<p>By default, the ranking is ordered according to the total
		individual score obtained by each student, although this order can be
		modified by choosing another ordering parameter and pressing its name.</p>
	<p>
		It is also possible to access the ranking by teams through the option
