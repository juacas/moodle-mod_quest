	<b>Use password</b>
</p>

<p align="justify">This option allows to set an access password to
	this QUESTOURnament. To protect a QUESTOURnament with a password can be
	necessary, for example, when that QUESTOURnament is used by several
	groups of students in a course, and must be opened to each group in a
	different time slot, in which case, the access password will not allow
	that a group of students can access the QUESTOURnament once it is
	opened to another different group of students but not for them yet.</p>
