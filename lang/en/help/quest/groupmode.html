	<strong>Group Mode</strong>
</P>

<P align="justify">The group mode can be one of three levels:</P>
<div align="justify">
	<ul>
		<li><strong>No groups</strong>: There are no sub groups, everyone
			is part of one big community.</li>
		<li><strong>Separate Groups</strong>: Each group can only see
			their own group, others are invisible.</li>
		<li><strong>Visible Groups</strong>: Each group works in their
			own group, but can also see other groups.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<P align="justify">The group mode can be defined at two levels:</P>

<div align="justify">
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Course Level</strong>: The group mode defined at the
			course level is the default mode for all activities defined within
			that course.</li>
		<li><strong>Activity Level</strong>: Each activity that supports
			groups can also define its own grouping mode. If the course is set to
			"<a href="help.php?module=moodle&amp;file=groupmodeforce.html">force
				group mode</a>" then the setting for each activity is ignored.</li>
	</ul>
