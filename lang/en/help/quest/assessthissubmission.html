	<strong>Assess Challenge</strong>
</P>

<P align="justify">This page allows the teacher to assess the work
	of the students that propose challenges in the QUESTOURnament. The
	score given will depend both on the labour of the student as author of
	a challenge and as evaluator of the answers received.</P>

<P align="justify">In order to facilitate the assessment of the
	task, a set of assessment elements, each one covering an aspect to
	assess in the task, will be used. For each assessment element it will
	be necessary to:
<div align="justify">
	<OL>
		<LI>Introduce a score by clicking the adequate radio button,
			selecting an option in a selection list presented,ect., which will
			depend on the scale used for that assessment element.
		<LI>Introduce an explanation of why that score is given. If it is
			considered that the reason is obvious, this field can be left empty.
			However, it must be taken into account that the student whose work is
			being assessed can make a complaint about the score received.
	</OL>
</div>

<P align="justify">It is also possible to make a general comment
	about the work assessed. This comment must be respetful and
	constructive. The score and comments made will be accessbile to the
	author of the challenge. The teacher will be able to manually modify
	the global score, in case it is necessary to adjust the score
	automatically calculated.
<P align="justify">
	The maximum possible score for the author of the challenge will be the
	maximum score reached by the challenge during its lifetime, whenever a
	correct answer has been submitted. On the other had, if no correct
	answer is received before the challenge closes, its <a
