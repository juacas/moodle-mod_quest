		individual and in teams.</p>
	<p align="justify">QUESTOURnament offers the possibility of
		answering challenges or questions proposed by teachers or students
		during a period of time defined as the lifetime of a contest. Both the
		answers and the challenges submitted by students are assessed. These
		assessments are made by the teachers and by the students that have
		proposed challenges. The individual final score of each student will
		depend on these assessments. These individual scores and its evolution
		during the duration of the contest will be accessible at any time to
		the students through the contest ranking.</p>
	<p align="justify">Assessment forms are defined both for the
		assessment of the challenges proposed, and of the answers submitted.
		These assessment forms include a set of assessment elements, with
		their corresponding weights, that allow to determine the score
		obtained.</p>
