	<strong>PreviewChallenge Window</strong>
</P>
<p align="justify">This page shows the aspect of a challenge that is
	being edited with the Moodle editor after the different filters
	provided by the platform are applied.</p>
<p align="justify">This way, it will be able to preview the aspect
	of the challenge before its submission. This posibility is specially
	useful when a mathematical equation must be inserted for which it is
	necessary to introduce an expression with the adequate format that will
	be transformed by the filters provided by Moodle and whose final aspect
	can not be previewed in the editor of the platform.</p>
